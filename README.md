In this Assignment, I will create a key to encrypt a file and copy it to another file, and also through the same key I will decrypt and get the original text of the file, every time the user can create a new key whenever the user wishes, and the user can replace the key with another whenever he wants, but when changing the key it will Encrypt the file differently than before.
